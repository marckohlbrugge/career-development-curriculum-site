  <h2>Turing's Professional Development & Job Search Support</h2>
  <p>Turingâ€™s mission is to <em>unlock human potential</em> by training a diverse, inclusive student body to <em>succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Becoming familiar with the systems and tools we use at Turing</li>
    <li>Setting your expectations for what engagement, productive struggle, and feedback will be like as a Turing student</li>
    <li>Developing strategies to thrive in a rigorous, remote learning environment</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>It is expected that students arrive to your first Mod 0 Session prepared to engage, which includes having their computer, notebook, and workspace set up. Students can prepare by carefully following the directions on the Computer Setup page.</p>
  <p><strong>In order to pass Mod 0 and start Mod 1 on the expected timeline, students must attend all Mod 0 Sessions and submit the Mod 0 Project on time, with high quality work.</strong></p>
