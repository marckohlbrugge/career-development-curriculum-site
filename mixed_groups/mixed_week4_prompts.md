## Structuring the Conversation
You are meeting with your mixed group for an hour today to collaborate on strategies for successful interviews. Below is an outline for how we encourage you to use this time, but we also encourage you as a group to think about what you'd like to accomplish together.

### Introductions (10 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program & Cohort
* What brought you to Turing? OR What do you want your career to look like as a software developer?

### Establishing Group Norms (8-10 mins)
Here are some suggested norms to start with:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can they let you know that they value you?

Please discuss any additional norms you would like to set as a group!

### Group Discussion (35 mins)

1. **Learning Goals:**

   * Individually, write down one thing you'd like to get out of today's discussion on the topic of interviewing. If you feel comfortable, please share this intention with the group as you get started. 

2. **Storytelling practice.** An interview is how companies get to know you; however, there's a lot to cover in a short amount of time. It's important to be able to tell your professional story in a way that allows someone to get to know you quickly.  

    * Take 5 minutes to review your story and get your main talking points in your head. Hint: use the questions "who are you," "why are you here," and "What's next" to help you prepare.
    * Practice sharing your story with the rest of the group and keep it to about 2 minutes per person (shorter is even better!). Provide feedback for each other that is specific, actionable, and kind around how they could make the story more concise and clear.

3. **Practice talking about projects.**

4. **Practice talking about specific experiences.** For each of the following common interview questions, 
  
  
  * A lesson where students read questions and consider: What is the underlying question here? For example, "Name a time where you worked on a team and a conflict occurred" is really asking "Are you empathetic?"
* Time for students to prepare 5-10 stories that hit the big umbrella question themes.
* A lesson where students think of what they want to know about a company and then write questions to getting to those answers. For example, if you want to know if you'll be supported/listened to, ask "What does the feedback cycle look like? How often will I get feedback from my manager? How will I be able to give feedback to my manager?" OR if you want to know a company's true values, ask someone who has been at the company for 2+ years, "What has changed about the company since you started? What has stayed the same?"
* Add in time to write their specific stories/examples and practicing their professional story; Add this to Mix It Up group prompts in week 4 to focus interview prep on building your stories + practice their professional stories

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Review the learning goals you set out to achieve today. Did you make progress? What are you proud of? What wins can you take away from this conversation today? Finally, how could you continue building relationships and sharing advice this Mix It Up group outside of today's conversation?
