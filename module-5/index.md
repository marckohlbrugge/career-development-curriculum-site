Graduating from Turing is a huge accomplishment! However, your Turing journey isn't complete until you secure your first technical job, and your Career Development team is here to continue to support you!

### Job Search Coaching: What you can expect from us

You paid for this! Career development and job search support is included in Turing tuition, but beyond that, we do not fulfill our mission without supporting every graduate to find a fulfilling technical job. This means that we will not only provide you with ongoing customized support but we will also refer you to positions that are aligned with your interests and skills. 

### Job Seeker Expectations: What we expect from you
We are going to provide as much support as you need, but this is a partnership with every job seeker -- you are expected to participate in this mentorship until you secure your first technical job.

What does this mean? 
* Attending weekly small group meetings and/or setting up 1:1 coaching session with your Career Specialist
* Responding to messages from your Career Specialist in a timely manner
* Engaging with feedback from your Career Specialist
* Completing required surveys and other deliverables
* Following up on agreed upon action steps with your Career Specialist
* Communicating any challenges or other circumstances that are affecting your job search

It's important for us to know what's going on with you in regards to your job search, and regular communication will be key. We can't help you if we don't hear from you! 

### Small Group Coaching: What it looks like
Each week, you'll have the opportunity to participate in a variety of small group activities. The most up-to-date information will be posted in the #module-5 channel on Slack, but here are some potential topics of discussion:

* Networking strategies
* Resume or cover letter review workshops
* Interview strategies
* Dealing with rejection
* Time management & scheduling

There will also be regular working sessions and self-care-focused sessions.

### Mental Health Support
Reminder that job seekers in good standing continue to have access to Turing's mental health counselor Jun Akiyama. If you are located in Colorado, you can sign up directly for a 1:1 session with Jun. If you are not located in Colorado, you can still join the lunch groups that Jun hosts every week. Find out more in #announcements on Slack or [here](https://sites.google.com/casimircreative.com/counseling). 

### Calendar
The Mod 5 Events Calendar provides information for upcoming group check-ins, guest speakers, and any additional events for job seekers. If you have questions or need further information, please feel free to contact members of the Career Dev team.
