title: Module 3 Professional Development
---

### Overview
Our approach to Mod 3 is to build on the competencies covered in the previous modules so that students can refine their resumes and interview skills, build portfolios, write effective cover letters, and execute their job search strategies.

Find more specifics here on [Mod 3 Key Learning Goals & Outcomes](/module_three/mod3_learning_goals).

### Lessons & Activities
* Week 1: [Resumes & Portfolios](/module_three/mod3_week1)

### Deliverables & Due Dates

* Terminal portfolio created and at least in draft form with resume uploaded and most components completed (with the exception of the About Me section and projects) by EOD Monday of Week 6. Reminder to refer to these [directions](/resources/terminal_directions) when working on your portfolio.

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 3, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_three/m3_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
