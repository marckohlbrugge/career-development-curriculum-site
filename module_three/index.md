### Overview
Our approach to Mod 3 is to build on the competencies covered in the previous modules so that students can refine their resumes and interview skills, build portfolios, write effective cover letters, and execute their job search strategies.

Upload your resume and a      job description, and jobscan will highlight the key experience, and skills recruiters like      to see.

   * ** **
   
4. **Create a cover letter based on a job description:** 
   * Tailor your cover letter from a job description
   * Use the job description to choose key skills and responsibilities to highlight. 
   * Then focus your cover letter on the 2-to 3 of the most important skills that resonate the        most with you. 
   * Review:
     the [Guided Cover letter template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctPSIEcZ5nrnfD4y0HlTUH9tdYRscbIjXhMQLjMPzPA/edit) for tips      on formatting,structure and writing a solid cover letter.

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 3, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_three/m3_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
