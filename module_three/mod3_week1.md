* ATS- Friendly is: a single column format, uses standard section headings, uses standard bullet points,and
avoid images,tables,headers,footers.
* Technically Focused: has at least 2 projects, technical skills are listed, includes links to your repos and deployed apps. For group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.

###  Section 2: Overview on How to Build a Great Terminal Portfolio

Turing provides a space for professional portfolios on [our website](https://terminal.turing.edu). Employers come to this part of our site to find candidates, and we also share these with employers who come to us asking for candidates. Terminal also functions as a job board -- this is where the job postings in #job-hunt come from. 

Creating your unique portfolio is the perfect opportunity to showcase your skills!
