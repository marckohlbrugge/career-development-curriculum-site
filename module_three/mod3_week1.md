### Section 1: Resume Review 
A key delieverable for Mod 3 is to have a full resume draft that is technically focused and ATS-Friendly: 
* ATS- Friendly is: a single column format, uses standard section headings, uses standard bullet points,and
avoid images,tables,headers,footers.
* Technically Focused: has at least 2 projects, technical skills are listed, includes links to your repos and deployed apps. For group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.
