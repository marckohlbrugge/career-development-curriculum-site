### Action steps to guide your resume draft.

A key deliverable for Mod 3 is to have a full resume draft that is technically focused and ATS-Friendly:

* **ATS-Friendly**: a single column format, uses standard section headings, uses standard bullet points,and
avoid images,tables,headers,footers.
* **Technically Focused**: has at least 2 projects, technical skills are listed, includes links to your repos and deployed apps. For group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.

* If you are in the process of developing your resume draft and want a quick review of certain sections, check out the following resources:
* [Resume checklist and resources](/resources/resume_resources)  
* Listen to [Mod 2 Resume Lesson and ATS videos](/module_two/mod2_week1). 

Videos are 1-3 minutes in length and cover the following sections of the Technical Resume:

1. Contact Information, title and headline (optional)
2. Resume Summary (optional)
3. Skils and Keywords
4. Technical Projects
5. Work Experience
6. Education and Training

When you have a completed resume, use [JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/) to upload your resume and a job posting to see how ready your resume is for that posting.

Employers come to this part of our site to find candidates, and we also share these with employers who come to us asking for candidates.
