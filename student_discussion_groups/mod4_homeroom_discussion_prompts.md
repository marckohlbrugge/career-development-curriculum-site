title: Mod 4 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 4, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. In the first part, homeroom groups will meet to establish norms for how your group wants to work together (30 mins):

   Suggested Format:
  * Brief introductions and each person shares something fun about themselves: 5 minutes.
  * Review agenda: Decide who will keep the time or how it can be done. 5 minutes.

  Stand up:  
  Each person has five minutes to share their PD progress. 20 minutes.
  * What progress did you make last mod?
  * What will you focus on next?
  * What is getting in your way?
  * What support or accountability would be helpful from the team?
 
2. Next, plan and share goals they want to accomplish by the next homegroup meeting in week 3. 30 minute
   
  15 minutes for self-reflection. Which two goals will help you move the needle on your professional development over the next two weeks? (job search,   networking, interview practice, career materials).
   
 * Write them out as SMART Goals:
 * Specific -what will be accomplished? (what actions will you take?)
 * Measurable- How will you measure the goal? (how much? how well?)
 * Achievable-Is the goal doable? (Do you have the necessary resources?)
 * Relevant- Why is the result important?
 * Time-bound-What is the time frame for accomplishing this goal? (add tasks to your calendar or another tool)

3. Wrap up: 10 minutes
 * Take turns sharing a takeaway: a question, the need for support, or action item (s).
 * How will you hold each other accountable for your goals?
 * What will you do to celebrate?
