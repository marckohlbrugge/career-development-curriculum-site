### Learning Goals
* Connect elements of Professional Storytelling and Branding to develop a technically focused resume
* Understand the Applicant Tracking System in selecting resume formats
* Generate a resume that reflect your skills and your professional story 

Today as you start on this, consider these questions:

* What kinds of jobs will you be targeting?
* What should your resume include to show that these are the jobs youâ€™re both qualified for and seeking?  
* What questions or concerns do you have about building your tech resume? 

### Connect your Personal Brand to build your Resume
As you start to think about your resume, your professional career story and personal brand will serve as a foundation. You can't build an effective resume until you know what story you want it to tell. And we'll start here by addressing a common misconception that resumes should be one-size-fits-all. Not only should you customize your resume for each job you apply to, but your resume should also be a **direct reflection of your job search strategy.** 

#### Technical Resumes Lead with Projects
Since you are a software developer now, your software projects are an essential -- arguably, the **most** essential -- part of your new resume. You should include:

* Turing projects
* Side projects
* Open Source projects

You should include links to your repos and deployed apps. For group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.

Your descriptions for your projects should tell an employer what the project is and what is does in as few words as possible. The rest of the description should be about accomplishments from that project and value added. What was your role in the project? What specific goals did you meet?

#### Customizing Your Resume is About Telling Your Story
Reminder that you should **always** customize your resume to the position for which you're applying. To make sure your resume is customized, pay attention to 3 things:

1. Telling your story through a summary statement
2. Showcasing specific projects
3. Highlight transferable skills

We recommend using a summary statement on your new resume so that you can:

1. Describe why you've made a career change
2. Make a connection between the company you're applying to and the work you do/want to do

Again, your projects can be used to your advantage to tell a specific story to this company as well. Showcase the projects that use the same tech stack, relate to a similar product, demonstrate your interest in their work, or showcase teamwork that is similar to the company you're applying to. A great idea is to build a project using a company's tech stack -- you'll discuss this more in-depth with Ian in his workshop.

And lastly, highlight your most relevant transferable skills -- both technical and professional -- that relate to this particular company.

#### Create an ATS-ready Resume
An ATS, or applicant tracking system, is used by most companies to screen resumes. Each ATS system is different -- when creating your resume, think about your audience, both in terms of content and the process of submitting the resume. **It's always important to follow the directions for that specific company**, but here are a few key components to keep in mind when creating a resume that is optimized for ATS systems:

* Use a Word doc or a Google Doc (which can be downloaded as a Word doc) to use as your main copy. Not all ATS systems can read PDFs.
* Use a single column. 
* Compare your resume to the job description and pull out key words to highlight in your skills and experience. **An ATS system will not assume you have a skill unless you list it. If it's in the job description, add it to your skills.** [Learn more about how to approach ATS systems here](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems).

#### Other Important Reminders
When building your resume, make sure to keep this checklist handy as well:

* Double check your spelling, grammar, and readability. How? Read it out loud to yourself to hear how it sounds AND ask a peer or mentor to read it also. As with coding, it never hurts to get a second set of eyes on something.
* Do not lie. This is important. Expect to be asked about **anything** that is listed on your resume. If your resume does not accurately represent you, you will not get this job, and it will hurt your chances at that company in the future.
* List work and education in chronological order. If you're concerned about gaps in your employment, list the length of time at a position rather than the dates.
* Include your contact information. Email is absolutely needed, but you can also include your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. There are differing opinions on phone numbers, but you can decide at your own discretion.
* Don't include a headshot -- it will take up valuable space and it's not a norm in this industry.
* Your resume should only be 1 page. Employers will not read past that 1 page.
* There are a lot of templates you can use, but be conservative with colors. Consider readability and printability.
* Don't list your special interests or hobbies. They don't belong on a technical resume. Instead, you can put them on your LinkedIn profile.put them on your LinkedIn profile.
