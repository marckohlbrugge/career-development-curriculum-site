title: Mod 2 Week 5
---

### Overview
This is your final PD activity during this module. By the end of today, the goal is for you to achieve:

* A *working draft* of your resume (this isn't a final draft -- it's a starting place!)

What should a working draft of your resume look like? The minimum requirements are:

* No more than 1 page
* Heading/Contact Information
* Technical Skills
* Technical Projects
* Experience
* Education

A summary is optional but highly recommended to give some insight into your career change and goals.

For all the details on how to build an effective resume, check out the guidelines [here](/resources/resume_resources) or [refer back to the lesson](/module_two/mod2_week1).

### Workshop Guidelines
This workshop takes place during Week 5 Homeroom.

1. Revisit your norms as a group to understand how you'll approach feedback with each other in this space (5 mins)
2. Status check (5 mins)
   * What work have you done on your resume already? What do you feel good about? 
   * What do you want to have completed by the end of today's working session?
3. Spend 30 minutes working on your ATS-ready resume draft. Again, [use these resources here](/resources/resume_resources)
4. Use the remaining 20 minutes for feedback. Each person gets a chance to share their resume draft for about 5-7 minutes and each person should provide feedback that is specific, actionable, and kind.

### Reminders
* **Update your resume draft** using the feedback you got today.
* **Continue building your job search strategy using the [resources from Week 3](/module_two/mod2_week3).** 
* **Complete 1 networking activity** from [Week 2's lesson](/module_two/mod2_week2)
