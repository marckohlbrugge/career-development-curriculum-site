Your desired job title is one of the most essential keywords applicant tracking system's when screening resumes.

If you’re considering a summary statement: 
* Think about what relevant and novel information you can provide the employer.
* Which transferable skills matter to this role? 
* What's your zone of genius? Where do you gain energy in your work? What impact do you want to have in this role/company?


#### Section 3: Skills and Keywords

A good rule of thumb is only include the technical skills you’re comfortable talking about in an interview.

#### Section 4: Technical Projects
Since you are a software developer now, your software projects are essential -- arguably, the **most** vital -- part of your new resume.

* Think of your bullets points as Storytelling -Short, accomplishment stories.
* Quantify impact with a #, % or $ amount whenever possible. I did X and the result was Y; state the result or outcome.

2. Create a resume first draft with these steps to get started:

  * First, plan the framework of your resume based on the lesson:
    * Will you use a resume summary? 
    * What relevant work experience will be used?
    * Which prior education and training will be added?
    * Which industry specifc skills are most important right now to add?

     * Use [this resume checklist](https://careerdev.turing.edu/resources/resume_resources) to guide your draft           development. 
     * Your resume must have technical projects. Use some of the projects you've created thus far in the                   program to help you write out your bulleted descriptions (you can swap them out later for other projects, but       working on concisely describing them is good practice).

     * Name of project
     * Number of collaborators ( solo, paired, or group) primary technologies used, what it does
     * Main learning goals of the project (if you're not sure, ask your instructors)
