* Your desired job title is one of the most essential keywords for an employers’ applicant tracking system when screening through the resumes.
* A headline is optional it takes the place of a title abd sums up who you are and where you've succeededn in a condensed one liner. 
   
   Headline Example: Developer and Project Manager with Leadership Experience

### Section 2: Resume Summary (optional)
The Summary section is completely optional however, it can be strategically used as a career changer to connect the dots for an employer explainig why you've made a career change and your value add to the company.

If your’re considering a summary statement: 

* Think about what relevant and novel information can you provide the employer. Aim to provide a highlevel overview of your past success, present abilities and     future results you can deliver.  
* Which transferable skills matter to this role? 
* Whats your zone of zenius? Where do you gain energy in your work? What impact do you want to have in this role/company?

### Section 3: Skills and Keywords

* Job listings will have skills and keywords that the employer value. Tailor your resume with these skills to help your resume get pass the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). 
*  A good rule of thumb is to only include skills you’re comfortable talking about in an interview.
*  Soft or professional skills are considered by employers to be just as important as hard skills. However, they are harder to evaluate. Consider using them in the bullets points of the work experience section.  

### Section 4: Technical Projects
Since you are a software developer now, your software projects are an essential -- arguably, the **most** essential -- part of your new resume. You should include:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPcY1wrb2YM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* Turing projects
* Side projects
* Open Source projects

You should include links to your repos and deployed apps. For group projects that exist on your partner's GitHub, make sure you fork your own version and include that link instead.

Your descriptions for your projects should tell an employer what the project is and what is does in as few words as possible. The rest of the description should be about accomplishments from that project and value added. What was your role in the project? What specific goals did you meet?  What was the result/impact of your project/work? 

**A pro tip:  Projects can be used to your advantage to tell a specific story to this company as well. Showcase the projects that use the same tech stack, relate to a similar product, demonstrate your interest in their work, or showcase teamwork that is similar to the company you're applying to. A great idea is to build a project using a company's tech stack. 

Consider reorganizing your resume to lead with technical skills and projects.

### Section 5: Work Experience
* This section is ususally shorter than the project section. Highlight the most relevant prior experiene that will match the types of roles you will apply for.
  I did X and the result was Y; state the result or outcome. 
  
* Quantify impact with a #, % or $ amount whenever possible. 
*Think of your bullets points as Storytelling -Short, accomplishment stories. Aim to share how you added value in your roles vs telling what you did. 

### Section 6: Education and Training
Creating an “Education and Training” section-will help showcase your developer training and highlight your transferable qualifications.

* List eductaion in reverse chronological order form the most recent to least recent.
* Turing Education and Training should be listed first if its most recent. 
* Including the Turing accreditiation is a great way to add credibitily, and stand out from the competition.
