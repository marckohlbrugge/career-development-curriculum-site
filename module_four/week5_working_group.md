### Working Group Guidelines
Your homeroom today is a time to work on the above deliverables and get feedback from each other. Here is how you can structure your time:

1. Revisit your norms as a group to understand how you'll approach feedback with each other in this space (5 mins)
2. Status check (5 mins)
   * What do you feel best about right now as it relates to preparing for your job search? 
   * What is 1 action item you want to spend time working on today? What is your goal to have completed by the end of todayâ€™s working session?
3. Spend 30 minutes working on your chosen deliverable. 
4. Use the remaining 20 minutes for feedback. Each person gets a chance to share what they've been working on for about 5-7 minutes and each person should provide feedback that is **specific, actionable, and kind.**
