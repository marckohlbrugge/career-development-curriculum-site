* Any other supports you may need 

*Please note that you should only book with one of them at a time each week*

**Note:** Try to schedule interviews and coffee chats during PD work time NOT during PD sessions

Communication:

* Questions that you have that are relevant for the whole group, ask in the Cohort Combined Slack channel and tag both Tracey and Ryan
* DM both Tracey and Ryan directly:
  * If you will not be able to attend PD
  * When you get an offer
  * Interview updates and questions 
  * Time-sensitive application questions
  * Any other questions or concerns 

### Deliverables & Due Dates
**Deliverable #1:** Complete your Terminal portfolio. To complete this deliverable:

  * Upload your polished and targeted resume

Your Career Specialists will review all portfolios and send follow-up on anything to be completed before it can be published.

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

* [Mod 4 Homeroom Group Information](/student_discussion_groups/mod4_homeroom_discussion_prompts)
* [Mix It Up Group Discussions](/mixed_groups/index). As the most senior students at Turing, please be prepared to take an active role in the Mix It Up discussions. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please reach out to Allison!

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 4, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 4, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
