### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

  * [Mod 4 Homeroom Group Information](/student_discussion_groups/mod4_homeroom_discussion_prompts)
  * [Mix It Up Group Discussions](/mixed_groups/index). As the most senior students at Turing, please be prepared to take an active role in the Mix It Up discussions. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please reach out to Allison!

### Early Graduation Requirements

  * Attend and maintain above 80% attendance for the first 3 weeks of classes

  * Complete a 30/60/90 day plan outlining your professional development goals. This [article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/30-60-90-day-plan-instructions-template-example) may be helpful as a guide. You can use a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ak0aP-b8D99cD_uYNaw4Ojo7A8HaJnaTso_U1ooTCfo/edit#)  for your submission.

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 4, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 4, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
